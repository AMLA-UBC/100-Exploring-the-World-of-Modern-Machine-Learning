## AMLA 100 - Exploring the World of Modern Machine Learning

Introductory course that covers from the basics of neural networks to advanced deep learning methods introduced from 2016 through 2023. 
For AMLA members seeing this, we recommend watching the corresponding lecture videos before working through any of the files.
Most of the practices and tutorials are not listed in this repo, but are rather under the lecture video descriptions, sourced from Fast.AI, DeepLearning.AI, Google, etc.
This is because we only step in when particular concepts can be simplified, further explained, or applied to solving real-world problems.
