In the case of DDIM, the technique spreads out the noise in an image so that it becomes less noticeable. One of the advantages of DDIM is that it preserves the edges and details of the image while removing the noise. This is because the diffusion equations are applied only to the areas of the image that are close to the edges, and not to the areas that are already smooth. After running this cell, see the Files folder on Colab to view the DDIM sampling animation."
